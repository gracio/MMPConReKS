MMPConReKS
=========
This is a project under development. Built on the MMPC (Max Min Parent Child) algorithm, this version takes ReKS output (clusters) and return significant clusters. 
Note that several functions MMPConReKS.m calls on are not included (to be published). Therefore this project will not execute as is. To use, contact graceworkhuang@gmail.com.
